# Currency-Exchange-Conversion-Microservices
This project demonstrates a microservices architecture using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
It provides two core services:
Currency Exchange Service → provides exchange rates between currencies.
Currency Conversion Service → calculates converted amounts by calling the Currency Exchange Service.
The project also integrates service discovery, centralized configuration, API gateway, circuit breaker, retry, and logging to show how real-world microservices communicate and stay resilient
